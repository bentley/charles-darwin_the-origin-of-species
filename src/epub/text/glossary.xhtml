			<h2 epub:type="title">Glossary of the Principal Scientific Terms Used in the Present Volume</h2>
			<p>(I am indebted to the kindness of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr class="name">W. S.</abbr> Dallas for this Glossary, which has been given because several readers have complained to me that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dallas has endeavoured to give the explanations of the terms in as popular a form as possible.)</p>

				<dt>Umbelliferae</dt>
				<dd>An order of plants in which the flowers, which contain five stamens and a pistil with two styles, are supported upon footstalks which spring from the top of the flower stem and spread out like the wires of an umbrella, so as to bring all the flowers in the same head (<b>Umbel</b>) nearly to the same level.

				<dt>Zooids</dt>
				<dd>In many of the lower animals (such as the Corals, Medusae, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) reproduction takes place in two ways, namely, by means of eggs and by a process of budding with or without separation from the parent of the product of the latter, which is often very different from that of the egg. The individuality of the species is represented by the whole of the form produced between two sexual reproductions; and these forms, which are apparently individual animals, have been called <b>Zooide</b>.</dd>
