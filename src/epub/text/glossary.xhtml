					<p>In many of the lower animals (such as the Corals, Medusae, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) reproduction takes place in two ways, namely, by means of eggs and by a process of budding with or without separation from the parent of the product of the latter, which is often very different from that of the egg. The individuality of the species is represented by the whole of the form produced between two sexual reproductions; and these forms, which are apparently individual animals, have been called <b>Zooide</b>.</p>
